# ALX Listing App

A simple Airbnb-like listing app where users can view and book rooms.  
The goal of this project is to practice frontend development concepts such as layouts, reusable components, and type safety.

## Project Structure

- **components/** – Reusable UI components that promote modularity and maintainability.
- **interfaces/** – Contains TypeScript interfaces (e.g., `CardProps`, `ButtonProps`) in `interfaces/index.ts` to ensure type safety and consistency.
- **constants/** – Stores app-wide constants for easy configuration and reference.
- **public/assets/** – Static assets such as images, SVGs, and other resources used throughout the project.
